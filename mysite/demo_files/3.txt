outset of the war he would have done so at any cost including by allowing slavery to continue But abolishing slavery would become a nonnegotiable objective for him as the war progressed because of his own long expressed abhorrence for the practice and because of the growing antislavery sentiment among his fellow Northerners His intransigence on the subject scuttled possibilities of a peace conference between the Union and the Confederacy in 1864 By winning the war he achieved both these objectives reunion and abolition Read more below Life Outbreak of the U S Civil WarWhat is Abraham

War and brought about the emancipation of enslaved people in the United States Lincoln and his cabinetAbraham Lincoln statue at the Lincoln MemorialAmong American heroes Lincoln continues to have a unique appeal for his fellow countrymen and also for people of other lands This charm derives from his remarkable life story the rise from humble origins the dramatic death and from his distinctively human and humane personality as well as from his historical role as saviour of the Union and emancipator of enslaved people His relevance endures and grows especially because of his eloquence as a spokesman for democracy In his view the Union was worth saving not only for its own sake but because it embodied an ideal the ideal of self government In recent years the political side to Lincoln s character and his racial views in particular have come under close scrutiny as scholars continue to find him a rich subject for research The Lincoln Memorial in Washington D C was dedicated to him on

backwoods cabin 3 miles 5 km south of Hodgenville Kentucky and was taken to a farm in the neighbouring valley of Knob Creek when he was two years old His earliest memories were of this home and in

England to Massachusetts in 1637 Though much less prosperous than some of his Lincoln forebears Thomas was a sturdy pioneer On June 12 1806 he married Nancy Hanks The Hanks genealogy is difficult to

1816 faced with a lawsuit challenging the title to his Kentucky farm Thomas Lincoln moved with his family to southwestern Indiana There as a squatter on public land he hastily put up a half faced camp a crude structure of logs and boughs with one side open to the weather in which the family took shelter behind a blazing fire Soon he built a permanent cabin and later he bought the land on which it stood Abraham helped to clear the fields and to take care of the crops but early acquired a dislike for hunting and fishing In afteryears he recalled the panther s scream the bears that preyed on the swine and the poverty of Indiana frontier life which was pretty pinching at times The unhappiest period of his boyhood followed the death of his mother in the autumn of 1818 As a ragged nine year old he saw her buried in the forest then faced a winter without the warmth of a mother s love Fortunately before the onset of a second winter Thomas Lincoln brought home from Kentucky a new wife for himself a new mother for the children Sarah Bush Johnston Lincoln a widow with two girls and a boy of her own had energy and affection to spare She ran the household with an even hand treating both sets of children as if she had borne them all but she became especially fond of Abraham and he of her He afterward referred to her as his angel mother Britannica Quiz American Civil War Quiz What Pop

were almost completely illiterate and he himself received little formal education He once said that as a boy he had gone to school by littles a little now and a little then and his entire schooling amounted to no more than one year s attendance His neighbours later recalled how he used to trudge for miles to borrow a book According to his own statement however his early surroundings provided absolutely nothing to excite ambition for education Of course when I came of age I did not know much Still somehow I could read write and cipher to the rule of three but that was all Apparently the young Lincoln did not read a large number of books but thoroughly absorbed the few that he did read These included Parson Weems s Life and Memorable Actions of George Washington with its story of the little hatchet and the cherry tree Daniel Defoe s Robinson Crusoe John Bunyan s Pilgrim s Progress and Aesop s Fables From his earliest days he must have had some familiarity with the Bible for it
