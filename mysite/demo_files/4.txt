enslavement of people to continue in southern states but he outlawed its spread to other existing states and states that might later join the Union Southern leaders didn t agree with this plan and decided to secede or withdraw from the nation Eventually 11 southern states formed the Confederate States of America to oppose the 23 northern states that remained in the Union The Civil War
